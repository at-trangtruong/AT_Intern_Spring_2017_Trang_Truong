####Exercise 1:
#####Description:

You need to write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

- At least six characters long
- contains a lowercase letter
- contains an uppercase letter

Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters.

####Exercise 2:
#####Description:

You have to create a method, that corrects a given time string. There was a problem in addition, so many of the time strings are broken. Time-Format is european. So from "00:00:00" to "23:59:59".

Some examples:

"09:10:01" -> "09:10:01"
"11:70:10" -> "12:10:10"
"19:99:99" -> "20:40:39"
"24:01:01" -> "00:01:01"

If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value!
If the time-string-format is invalid, return null.

####Exercise 3:
#####Description:

Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2 return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the strings of a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.

######Example 1:

a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]
